## Prerequisites

Requires the .NET Framework 4.6. The .NET version 4.6 is used explicitly, as it defines the lowset common .NET version for Windows 10. Even the first Windows 10 versions are coming with .NET Framework 4.6. So we do not introduce any dependency here.

## Usage

Simply starting the program during OOBE [Shift] + [F10] and providing the Autopilot-Manager app service address as parameter.
